### <a name="getting started"></a>Getting Started

So, what do I need to get started?

* A Windows or Mac computer
* The Google Chrome web browser
* Your Greenville Chorale email address (something@greenvillechorale.org)
* Your Greenville Chorale password

You should have received the email address and password already - be sure to save them!

If you haven't received them, or misplaced them, contact Fred Laxton.

* Windows users - if you use Microsoft Outlook, save them in a Contact
* Mac users - open the Contacts app and save them there - they'll also be saved in iCloud

Make the name of the card something like "Greenville Chorale email account" or some such, in the business name field (not First/Last name)

In the notes of the contact, put the email address and password.

If you don't have the Google Chrome web browser, you can get it here:

[https://google.com/chrome](https://google.com/chrome)

*(You can also optionally set up email on your Android or iPhone smartphone.)*

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/flaxton/greenvillechorale-google-workspace/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/flaxton/greenvillechorale-google-workspace/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
