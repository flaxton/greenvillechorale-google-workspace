### <a name="getting started"></a>Getting Started

So, what do I need to get started?

* A Windows or Mac computer
* The Google Chrome web browser
* Your Greenville Chorale email address (something@greenvillechorale.org)
* Your Greenville Chorale password

__*You should have received the email address and password already - be sure to save them!*__

If you haven't received them, or misplaced them, contact Fred Laxton.

* Windows users - if you use Microsoft Outlook, save them in a Contact
* Mac users - open the Contacts app and save them there - they'll also be saved in iCloud

Make the name of the card something like "Greenville Chorale email account" or some such, in the business name field (not First/Last name)

In the notes of the contact, put the email address and password.

If you don't have the Google Chrome web browser, you can get it here:

[https://google.com/chrome](https://google.com/chrome)

Why use Google Chrome? Because Google Workspace is made by Google, and other web browsers may not work properly.

### <a name="gmail"></a>Gmail

What is Gmail? It's the email system for Google accounts. Greenville Chorale is using Google Workspace, hence Google email, even though the addresses are something@greenvillechorale.org.

**There are two ways to use your email account:**

* Use it directly on the website gmail.com, using the Google Chrome web browser
* Use it in an email program, such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail (all email programs can use it if you have another favorite)

You can mix and match these, sometimes using an email program like Outlook, other times going to gmail.com and using it there for certain featurs (such as linking to a file, instead of attaching it)

*(You can also optionally set up email on your Android or iPhone smartphone.)*

#### <a name="spam-folder"></a>Spam folder

You will have a Spam folder set up automatically, where Google puts anything that looks suspect. The filtering is not as good as it used to be (or perhaps there is more spam), so you should check your Spam folder daily.

If using gmail.com, scroll down and click the down arrow/More to see more folders, including Spam:

![Folders, showing More](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/spam-1.png)

![Folders expanded, showing Spam](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/spam-2.png)

If using Microsoft Outlook, be sure that "Gmail" is expanded, to see the Spam folder:

#### <a name="legitimate"></a>What to do when legitimate mail is sent to Spam?

As you check your Spam folder daily, you will find good email sent there.

To do this next step, you *must* login to gmail.com in a web browser if you're using an email program like Outlook.

Open the Spam folder in the left sidebar, check the box(es) on the emails that are good, and click "Not Spam".

This does two things:
* Moves the email to your Inbox
* "Trains" Google to not treat it as spam in the future (this is not 100% effective, but it does help)

#### <a name="linking"></a>Linking to a file instead of attaching one

Why would I want to "link" to a file instead of attaching it?

Because attaching a large file may be rejected by the sending or receiving email system.

Linking to a file avoids that issue üëç 

Instead of including the file, possibly exceeding the size limit, you are just including a link to it. The recipient clicks the link to view/download the file.

To do this:
* Go to gmail.com in Google Chrome.
* Click "Compose" to create a new email
* Fill it out as usual
* Instead of clicking the paper clip (attach a file), click the Google Drive symbol (a triangle)

![Link to file](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/link-to-file-1.jpg)

You'll go to another screen, showing (by default) "My Files" which are only your private files. If you want to link to a shared file, click on "Shared with Me" to see them. 

![Link to file](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/link-to-file-2.jpg)

Select the file in question.

Then be sure the button at the bottom has "Drive link" selected and click "Insert".

When you're satisfied that the email is filled out and the link inserted, click "Send".

### <a name="office"></a>Working with Microsoft Office files

Google Workspace can easily open any Microsoft Office files, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Powerpoint.

However, going forward, you should plan to use native Google Workspace file format equivalents: Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides.

So, how do you do that?

First, open Google Drive to see your files and folders.

Navigate to the folder where you want to add the Microsoft Office file.

Click the "+ New" button and select "File Upload"

This will open a window to your computer files. Navigate to the file, select it and click "Open"

Google Workspace will upload the file and open it.

You will see the file appear in the folder.

Double-click to open it.

Google Workspace will take a moment to convert it and then open it.

![Save as Google ...](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/convert-file-1.png)

Now select "Save as Google ..." where "..." is the type of file - Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.

Close the file.

Delete the original Microsoft Office file on Google Workspace, so only the Google Workspace version remains.

Congratulations! You've converted the Office format to Google Workspace format, making it much easier to work with going forward üëç

### <a name="training"></a>Additional (free) Google Workspace training

Google Workspace has free training courses here:

[https://cloud.google.com/training/workspace/#workspace-end-user-learning-path](https://cloud.google.com/training/workspace/#workspace-end-user-learning-path) 

I recommend the courses on:
* Gmail (if you intend to use Gmail in your web browser, not in a program like Outlook or Apple Mail)
* Google Drive - to manage your files/folders and shared files/folders
* Google Docs - word processor documents similar to Microsoft Word
* Google Sheets - spreadsheets similar to Microsoft Excel

There are other Google Workspace "apps" with training, which you might want to view as well üòÉ
